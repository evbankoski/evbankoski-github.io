# About Me
## My Interests: My most important interests have always been sports and computers. I like working and learning more about computers as well as playing games. I also like to play sports as well as watch them.
## Websites I recommend:
	-[NY Times] (NYTimes.com) I find the NY times very interesting and cool to read because they always have new interesting stories.
	-[YouTube] (youtube.com) I also find YouTube very cool and helpful because there is just videos for everything you would need and just all kinds of cool videos apart of different categories of things.
