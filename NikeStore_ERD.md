  PRODUCT {The product has a lot to do with how the business cycle moves along. Product can always make the price vary, the availability vary, and even the want and interest for the product. It can impact all of the other entitys
  and does on a regular basis. Product and customer will always have a bit of a relationship in how they move because there will not be customers if the product is not there. Product also has everything to do with inventory and sale,
  both of which are mainly based off of the product.}
  CUSTOMER {The customer will always the the running fuel of the business cycle because it all comes down to what they want and the decisions that they make. The product, inventory, and sales all impact it as well but at the end of
  the day the action is taken by the customer. A customer is always going to be interested in the product of course, and they may also be interested in the inventory of it in some cases.}
  SALE {Sale is a big part of the business cycle and keeping it moving. A sale is basically a transaction that happens within the cycle. It is the outcome of the customers and whoever else dealing with a situation usually involving
  inventory and a specific product or type of product. The sale is a very important part in the process and it keeps the business operations moving along.}
  INVENTORY {Inventory is the main reason that the busines cycle goes around. Everyone is trying to purchase, or do something with another product or something. Inventory is basically all of the product that someone or a place has
available. Inventory is what keeps the customers coming in to purchase, and inventory is the holding of the products, that are to be sold. Inventory supports the business operations because having more inventory always will make things
easier and usually will mean you have more value in whatever you are doing.}
